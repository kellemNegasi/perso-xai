  Lay/end user prioritizing medium–high validity (accurate 'why', but not necessarily maximal coverage),
  medium reliability (felt as trustworthiness but not explicitly demanded), very high parsimony/interpretability
  (cognitive load dominates), high comparative 'why-not' insight (recourse framing, 'why me/what can I change?'),
  and mixed uncertainty communication (can help but may confuse).
