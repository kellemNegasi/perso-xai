preference_model:
  type: hierarchical_dirichlet
  description: >
    Preferences are sampled hierarchically using Dirichlet distributions.
    Mean preferences are derived from ordinal persona priorities; concentration
    (c) is treated as a confidence knob and swept in experiments.

  concentration:
    mode: fixed_and_sweep
    fixed:
      clinician: 50
      regulator: 50
      lay: 50
    sweep:
      enabled: true
      values: [1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]
    metric_level:
      lambda: 1
      note: "Metric-level concentration d_g = lambda * c."

  mean_preference_w0:
    note: >
      Compute w0 by normalizing ordinal scores:
        w0_i = s_i / sum_j s_j
      where s_i are persona/group scores on the 1–5 scale.
