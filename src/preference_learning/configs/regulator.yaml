  Regulatory/audit user prioritizing very high validity (audit defensibility), high reliability
  (robustness/consistency across cases), medium parsimony/interpretability (accepts complexity if it improves audit strength),
  high comparative 'why-not' insight (contestability/procedural fairness/recourse framing),
  and medium–high uncertainty communication (risk disclosure, robustness, calibration concerns).
